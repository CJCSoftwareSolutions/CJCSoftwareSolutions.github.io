      <description>So I decided that Jekyll wasn&amp;rsquo;t right for CJC Software Solutions site. We arent a ruby development company, our use of the language is mostly within the realms of CyberSecurity.
As Chris has a background in Golang, it seemed fitting that we use the Hugo site generation toolkit and the workflow for getting a site up and running has been great.
The site is fast and responsive and works well on mobile devices too.</description>
